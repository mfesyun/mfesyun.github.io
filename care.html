        Meals🥒
    </h3>
    <p>
        The average guinea pig should eat hay, vegetables, fruit, and herbs. They should not have a limited supply of food. 
Guinea pigs must eat constantly to help their digestive system process food well. This is why they also poop a lot.
<h3>
How Often To Clean The Cage And Pamper Them🫧
</h3>
<p>
    Your guinea pig should be washed at least every two months, and even more often if the fur is looking particulary oily.
    You should wash the guinea pig's cage once every week, and twice if you have two or more.

        Pampering🧖🏻‍♀️
    </h2>
    For nail clipping, make sure 
    to clip their nails at least once a month. If you have a long-haired guinea pig, make sure to brush them daily. Daily 
    brushing is also good for short-haired guinea pigs.
