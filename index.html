  <h3>
    Morning Schedule☀️
  </h3>
  <p>
    First, the two guinea pigs wake up and observe their surroundings. Then, they start realizing they are hungry. When they hear the sound of the patio door opening, they are happy to realize they are getting spring mix and hay pellets.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Afternoon Schedule🥗
  </h3>
  <p>
    After eating only six times after breakfast, the guinea pigs are very hungry. They listen for that precious sound of the patio door opening and start squeaking with joy. After eating, they enjoy some sightseeing of Mom working or doing yoga and the squirells begging for nuts.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Evening Schedule🌙
  </h3>
  <p>
    Zuza and Kalbasa have eaten nine times after lunch! That is very little. Zuza is very angry. Kalbasa is looking around, wondering why spinach doesn't have teeth and whatnot. The last meal of the day is fed and they go to sleep. Their adventurous schedule begins again.
