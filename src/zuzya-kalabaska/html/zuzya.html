            About Zuzya
        </h3>
        <p>
            Zuzya was born on April 1st, 2019. She is four years old. She is black, white, and has brown eyes
            indoors and red/blue eyes in the sunlight. She loves sping mix (a mix of spinach
            , red cabagge, and other leafy greens) and prefers that over anything except apples.
            She enjoys exploring when she is let out of her cage. She also loves palm tree leaves. 
            Two things that she detests beyond words are baths in the sink and nail clippings.
